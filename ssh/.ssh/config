#### Example SSH config file

# https://gist.github.com/chales/5448026
# Host = a list of domains, IPs and personalized aliases that use this config
# entry. These alias names follow "Host" and are space delimited.
#  e.g. Host 192.168.1.1 example.com example1 myalias1
# Hostname = the IP or real hostname
#  e.g. Hostname 192.168.1.1
# User = the username
#  e.g. User jdoe
# Port = if this is a non standard port, i.e. not 22
#  e.g. Port 2345

# The above would allow you to use 'ssh exp1' or 'ssh myalias1' which are now
# both equivalent commands for 'ssh jdoe@192.168.1.1 -p2345'
